// A FutexContext is the object which manages the state of all of the active
// futexes for a user-mode process.  Each ProcessDispatcher in the system will
// have a single FutexContext contained within it, and the objects should exist
// no-where else in the system.
//
// FutexContexts manage a pool of FutexContext::FutexStates which are
// contributed by threads created within the process.  This pool guarantees that
// threads are guaranteed to be able to allocate a FutexState object in O(1)
// time whenever they perform a FutexWait operation, as a Futex is only "active"
// when it has any waiters.  See (Grow|Shrink)FutexStatePool comments as well as
// the FutexState's notes (below) for more details.
//
// The remaining methods in the public interface implement the 3 primary futex
// syscall operations (Wait, Wake, and Requeue) as well as the one
// test/diagnostic operation (GetOwner).  See the zircon syscall documentation
// for further details.

  // the number of threads in a process.

  // it simply locks in order to activate the FutexStates and then unlocks.
  // Another thread can attempt a requeue in parallel, or it could exit in
  // parallel.  If only one FutexState were added for each thread, it would be
  // possible to run out of FutexStates if these operations were happening in

  // Notes about FutexState lifecycle.
  // aka. Why is this safe?
  //
  // FutexState objects are used to track the state of any futex which currently
  // has waiters.  Currently, each thread in a process allocates two FutexStates
  // and contributes them to its process' futex context's free pool.  When the
  // thread exits, it take two FutexStates out of the free pool and lets them
  // expire.
  //
  // There is a master spin lock for each process which protects the sets of
  // active and free FutexStates.  Any time a thread needs to work with futex
  // ID X, it must first obtain the process-wide pool lock and either find the
  // FutexState in the active set with that ID, or activate one from the free
  // list.  After this, the process wide pool lock is immediately released.
  //
  // In order to keep this FutexState from disappearing out from under
  // the thread during its Wait/Wake/Requeue operation, a "pending operation"
  // ref count is increased in the FutexState object.  FutexStates are returned
  // to the free pool _only_ when the pending operation count reaches zero.
  //
  // FutexState objects are managed using ktl::unique_ptr.  At all times, a
  // FutexState will be in one of three states.
  //
  // 1) A member of a FutexContext's active_futexes_ hashtable.  Futexes in this state are
  //    currently involved in at least one futex operation.  Their futex ID will
  //    be non-zero as will their pending operation count..
  // 2) A member of a FutexContext's free_futexes_ list.  These futexes are
  //    not currently in use, but are available to be allocated and used.
  //    Their futex ID and pending operation count will be zero.
  // 3) A member of neither.  These futexes have been created, but not added
  //    to the pool yet, or removed from the free list by a thread which is
  //    exiting.  Their futex ID and pending operation count will be zero.
  //
  class FutexState : public fbl::DoublyLinkedListable<ktl::unique_ptr<FutexState>> {
   public:
    // PendingOpRef is a simple RAII helper meant to help management of the
    // pending operation count ref-counting in a FutexState object.  All of the
    // ways to fetch a FutexState from the free/active sets will return a
    // PendingOpRef to represent the borrow from the pool instead of a raw
    // FutexState pointer.  By default, these object will release a pending
    // operation reference when they go out of scope.  They do this under the
    // protection of the outer FutexContext's pool_lock_, returning the
    // FutexState to the FutexContext's free pool when the pending operation
    // count reaches zero.
    //
    // There are a few special extensions to the PendingOpRef added in order to
    // support some optimizations in the futex code paths.
    //
    // :: CancelRef ::
    // When a thread is about to block on a futex, it will have a PendingOpRef
    // in scope which is holding a pending operation reference to the
    // FutexState.  The thread which is about to block needs to keep that
    // reference on the FutexState as it sleeps, but it should never make an
    // attempt to remove the reference itself when it wakes up again.  There are
    // two reasons for this but the most important one is that, because of the
    // FutexRequeue operation, it may block on Futex A, but get moved over to
    // Futex B while blocking.  By the time it wakes up again, Futex A's
    // FutexState may no longer exist.
    //
    // When a thread has passed all of its checks and it is about to block, it
    // has entered the thread lock, and it uses CancelRef in order to cause its
    // PendingOpRef object to forget about the reference it is holding as it
    // blocks.
    //
    // :: SetExtraRefs ::
    // When a thread calls FutexWake, it will eventually enter the thread lock
    // in order to manipulate the targeted FutexState's wait queue.  For every
    // thread that it successfully wakes up from the wait queue, the wakeup
    // thread assumes responsibility for the woken thread's pending operation
    // reference.  This way, a thread which is successfully woken from a
    // FutexWake operation does not need to acquire any locks on its way out.
    // The thread which woke it up will release its pending operation reference
    // for it.  In order to account for these extra references, the waking
    // thread may call "SetExtraRefs" to account for the references that it took
    // responsibility for during the wake operation.
    //
    // Likewise, SetExtraRefs gets used on the slow path of a thread unblocking
    // from FutexWait.  In the case that a thread unblocks from FutexWait with
    // an error (timeout, thread killed, etc...), it will first wake up and find
    // it's FutexState using its blocking_futex_id_ member.  This may not be the
    // same futex that it originally blocked on.  Once the thread has found the
    // FutexState, it will be holding one pending operation reference as a
    // result of the find operation.  It needs to add another to account for the
    // pending operation reference it placed on the state when it originally
    // went to sleep.  It uses SetExtraRefs to accomplish this.
    //
    // :: TakeRefs ::
    // Finally, during a requeue operation, we are moving threads which are
    // currently blocked on futex A over to futex B.  As we do this, we need to
    // make sure to move their pending operation references at the same time.
    // TakeRefs is the method which allows us to do this.
