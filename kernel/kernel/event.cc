 * @file
 * @brief  Event wait and signal functions for threads.
 * @defgroup event Events
 *
 * An event is a subclass of a wait queue.
 *
 * Threads wait for events, with optional timeouts.
 *
 * Events are "signaled", releasing waiting threads to continue.
 * Signals may be one-shot signals (Event::AUTOUNSIGNAL), in which
 * case one signal releases only one thread, at which point it is
 * automatically cleared. Otherwise, signals release all waiting threads
 * to continue immediately until the signal is manually cleared with
 * Event::Unsignal().
