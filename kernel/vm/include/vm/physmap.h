// Why does this function exist?
//
// The physmap is mapped early in boot and contains a contiguous mapping of a large portion of the
// physical address space, which may include device memory regions (think MMIO).  If the device
// memory remains mapped, hardware based memory prefetching might attempt to read from device
// memory.  That would be bad.  Ideally, we wouldn't map the device memory in the first place, but
// that's easier said that done (fxb/47856).
//
// The second best thing is to unmap the non-arena memory.  There are two problems with that
// approach.  One, on arm64 the physmap was mapped using 1GB pages.  However, the arm64 MMU Unmap
// code does not yet know how to deal with (i.e. split) 1GB pages (fxb/47920).  Two, Unmap attempts
// to free pages by returning them to the PMM.  However, the pages backing the phsymap's page tables
// didn't come from the PMM.  They came from the bootalloc.
//
// So that leaves us with the third best approach: change the protection bits on the non-arena
// regions to prevent caching.
//
// TODO(fxb/47856): Change the way the physmap is initially mapped.  Ideally, we would parse the
// boot data (ZBI) early on and only map the parts of the physmap that coorespond to normal memory.
// As it stands, we are still suseptible to problems arising from hardware prefetching device memory
// from the physmap.
