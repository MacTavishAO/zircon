// Notes for WaitQueue::BlockEtcPreamble and BlockEtcPostamble.
//
// Currently, there are two variants of WaitQueues in Zircon.  The standard
// WaitQueue (used for most tasks) and the specialized
// OwnedWaitQueues (used for mutexes/futexes/brwlocks, and anything else which
// needs to have a concept of priority inheritance).
//
// The "Block" operation for these two versions are _almost_ identical.  The
// only real difference between the two is that the OWQ implementation needs to
// stop after we have decided that we are actually going to block the thread,
// but before the timeout timer is armed and the thread is actually blocked, in
// order to update it's PI chain bookkeeping.
//
// Instead of duplicating the code, or exposing a code-injection
// mechanism into the public API, we split the code into two private
// inline member functions that we hide in instead.  The first
// (BlockEtcPreamble) performs all of the checks and bookkeeping up-to
// the point of arming the timer and blocking, the second
// (BlockEtcPostamble) finishes the job.
//
// The traditional WaitQueue implementation of
// WaitQueue::BlockEtc just calls these two functions back to back, relying on
// the inlining to generate the original function.  The OwnedWaitQueue
// implementation does the same, but injects its bookkeeping at the appropriate
// point.
//
// Nothing but these two specific pieces of code should *ever* need to
// call these functions.  Users should *always* be using either
// WaitQueue::BlockEtc/Block, or OwnedWaitQueue::BlockAndAssignOwner
// instead.
