// Owned wait queues are an extension of wait queues which adds the concept of
// ownership for use when priority inheritance semantics are needed.
//
// An owned wait queue maintains an unmanaged pointer to a Thread in order to
// track who owns it at any point in time.  In addition, it contains node state
// which can be used by the owning thread in order to track the wait queues that
// the thread is currently an owner of.  This also makes use of unmanaged
// pointer.
//
// It should be an error for any thread to destruct while it owns an
// OwnedWaitQueue.  Likewise, it should be an error for any wait queue to
// destruct while it has an owner.  These invariants are enforced in the
// destructor for OwnedWaitQueue and Thread.  This enforcement is considered
// to be the reasoning why holding unmanaged pointers is considered to be safe.
//

  // A small helper class which can be injected into Wake and Requeue
  // operations to allow calling code to get a callback for each thread which
  // is either woken, or requeued.  This callback serves two purposes...
  //
  // 1) It allows the caller to perform some limited filtering operations, and
  //    to choose which thread (if any) becomes the new owner of the queue.
  //    See the comments in the |Action| enum member for details.
  // 2) It gives code such as |FutexContext| a chance to perform their own
  //    per-thread bookkeeping as the wait queue code chooses which threads to
  //    either wake or re-queue.
  //
  // Note that during a wake or requeue operation, the threads being
  // considered will each be presented to the user provided Hook (if any)
  // by the OwnedWaitQueue code before deciding whether or not to actually
  // wake or requeue the thread.
