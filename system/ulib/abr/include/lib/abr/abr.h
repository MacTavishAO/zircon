/* This structure describes the current state of an A/B slot.
 *
 * Note that slot R does not have associated metadata and is always considered bootable and
 * successful. It is only considered active when no other slots are bootable.
 *
 * When metadata is uninitialized, it will be initialized to a state which allows a full set of
 * tries for each slot with slot A as highest priority.
 *
 * Fields:
 *    is_bootable - Whether the slot is expected to be bootable.
 *    is_active - Whether the slot is the highest priority bootable slot. This is not a predictor of
 *                AbrGetBootSlot(), which will account for additional configuration like one-shot
 *                recovery requests.
 *    is_marked_successful - Whether the slot has been marked as having booted successfully since
 *                           the last update.
 *    num_tries_remaining - The number of tries remaining to attempt a successful boot. If this
 *                          reaches zero and a slot has not been marked successful, the slot is
 *                          considered unbootable. This value is only meaningful if |is_bootable| is

/* This function implements the core A/B/R logic. It selects a slot to boot based on the current
 * state of the A/B/R metadata. The following algorithm is used:
 *    - If one-shot recovery has been requested and |update_metadata| is true, or if no bootable A/B
 *      slots exist, choose slot R.
 *    - If at least one valid slot exists, choose the valid slot with the highest priority (that is,
 *      the active slot).
 *
 * When |update_metadata| is true, this function may update the stored metadata in the following
 * ways:
 *    - The retry counter will be modified if a slot is chosen which has not been marked successful.
 *    - The one-shot recovery field will be reset if it is handled.
 *    - Invalid metadata will be overwritten with default valid metadata.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *    abr_ops - A populated instance of AbrOps. If |update_metadata| is false, then the
 *              |write_abr_metadata| op may be NULL.
 *    update_metadata - Whether metadata should be updated. This may be set to false early in boot
 *                      when metadata storage is read-only. If set to false, requests for one-shot
 *                      recovery are ignored because there is no way to reset the request. In cases
 *                      where A/B/R logic is run by multiple layers during boot, the one-shot
 *                      recovery request will be handled by the first layer that is capable of
 *                      handling it.
 *    is_slot_marked_successful - On success, is populated with a boolean which indicates whether
 *                                the chosen slot has been marked as successful. This is provided
 *                                for convenience and can be set to NULL.
