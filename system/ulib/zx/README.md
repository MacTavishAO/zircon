# The C++ zx library

The intention of this library is to provide an idiomatic C++ interface
to using Zircon handles and syscalls. This library provides type
safety and move semantics on top of the C calls.

Within this library, const is used to indicate that a method does not
modify the object's handle. Methods marked as const may still mutate
the underlying kernel object.

This library does not do more than that. In particular, thread and
process creation involve a lot more than simply creating the
underlying kernel structures. For thread creation you likely want to
use the libc (or libc++ etc.) calls, and for process creation the
launchpad APIs.

This library is usable both within the Zircon repo as well as the
general Fuchsia gn build.
