# Fuchsia Command Line Parsing Library

This directory contains a C++ library that supports command line argument
parsing and usage help. The ultimate intent is to supply direct, straightforward
APIs that simplify enabling common features of a CLI application, and where
applicable, ensure compliance with
[Fuchsia guidelines](/docs/development/api/tools.md).
