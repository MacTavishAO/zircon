#include "asan_impl.h"

// In the ASan build, this file provides weak definitions for all the
// same entry points that are defined by the ASan runtime library.
// The definitions here are stubs that are used only during the
// dynamic linker's startup phase before the ASan runtime shared
// library has been loaded.  These are required to satisfy the
// references in libc's own code.
//
// LLVM provides no documentation on the ABI between the compiler and
// the runtime.  The set of function signatures here was culled from
// the LLVM sources for the compiler instrumentation and the runtime
// (see llvm/lib/Transforms/Instrumentation/AddressSanitizer.cpp and
// compiler-rt/lib/asan/*).

#if __has_feature(address_sanitizer)

// The non-fatal calls here might be made early in startup, before safe-stack
// and/or shadow-call-stack setup is done.  None of these use any unsafe stack
// (they take no addresses), and they're all either leaves or could be tail
// calls so they shouldn't need shadow call stack either.  But if not fully
// optimized, they might try to use them anyway.  So they're all marked with
// __NO_SAFESTACK (which also disables shadow-call-stack).

// This is referenced by generated code to decide whether to call
// __asan_stack_malloc_* instead of doing normal stack allocation.
// Never use stack malloc before the real runtime library is loaded.

// This is the one set of things we define for real just as the
// sanitizer runtime does.  Generated code calls these.  In practice,
// almost certainly nothing in the the startup path needs them, but
// defining them properly is barely more than defining trap stubs.
