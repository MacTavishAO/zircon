// This class implements an interface for filesystems to write back data to the underlying
// device. It provides methods for the following functionality:
// - Writing data to the underlying device
// - Writing metadata to the underlying device (journaled or unjournaled)
// - Revoking metadata from the journal
//
// The journal operates on asynchronous objects: it returns promises corresponding to
// each operation, which may be chained together by the caller, and which may be completed
// by scheduling these promises on the journal's executor via |journal.schedule_task|.
//
// EXAMPLE USAGE
//
//      Journal journal(...);
//      auto data_promise = journal.WriteData(vnode_data);
//      auto metadata_promise = journal.WriteMetadata(vnode_metadata);
//      journal.schedule_task(data_promise.and_then(metadata_promise));
//
//      // A few moments later...
//
//      journal.schedule_task(Sync().and_then([]() {
//          printf("Operation completed successfully!");
//      }));
//
// This class is thread-safe.
