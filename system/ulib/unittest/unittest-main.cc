// The library provides a default main function so test programs don't need a
// boilerplate main.  The main function is not special to the linker, so it can
// come from a library like any other.  Naturally, if the main program provides
// its own main function, the library's function will be ignored.

// TODO(BLD-353): It shouldn't be necessary for this to be weak.
// But the legacy Fuchsia GN build's "SDK import" logic turns a "source"
// library into a source_set() rather than an actual static library.
