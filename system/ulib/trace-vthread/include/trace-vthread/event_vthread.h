// Writes a virtual thread duration begin event.
// This event must be matched by a duration end event with the same category,
// name and virtual thread.
//
// Virtual thread durations describe work which is happening synchronously on
// a timeline other than the CPU's (E.g. the GPU).
// They can be nested to represent a control flow stack.
// The virtual thread id serves to identify the timeline within the process.
//
// 0 to 15 arguments can be associated with the event, each of which is used
// to annotate the duration with additional information.  The arguments
// provided to matching duration begin and duration end events are combined
// together in the trace; it is not necessary to repeat them.
//
// |category_literal|, |name_literal| and |vthread_literal| must be

// |timestamp| is the tick that the duration event begins.
