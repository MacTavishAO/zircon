Fuchsia Intel Ethernet Driver
=============================

This directory contains a port of the FreeBSD Intel ethernet driver. Original
source was obtained here:

    https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/tree/master/sys/dev/e1000

at hash 3258eeeb442b48695165a6cb66aabd5b8422478c, under the BSD-3-Clause
license (https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

This port contains the complete source of the FreeBSD driver, with a few
modifications and additions:

    em_txrx.c
    if_em.c
    if_em.h
    igb_txrx.c
        - These files are included from the FreeBSD driver, but not used for
          Fuchsia. They're included to ease future porting efforts, but aren't
          built or used by this project.

    fuchsia.c
        - New source file, adapted from the files listed above. This file
          provides the interface between the Fuchsia system and the
          generic/OS-independent code included with the driver.

    e1000api.c
    e1000api.h
        - Modified from original FreeBSD implementation to match Fuchsia
          requirements.
