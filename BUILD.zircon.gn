#
# TODO(BLD-353): Note this does not include build_api_module() uses meant
# just for legacy build integration.  We don't consider those to be actual
# build API modules; using build_api_module() is just a convenience for
# creating them.  Importantly, they are not part of the API contract with
# consumers of the overall build.  They're purely implementation details of
# the temporary Frankenbuild arrangement.

# This describes all the binaries linked by the build.
#
# This enumerates each linked binary (executable, shared library, or
# loadable/"plug-in" module).  This includes host tools, kernels, boot
# loaders, drivers, as well as normal executables.  It does not yet include
# any non-native binary formats.  This is meant to reach the entire
# dependency graph of all binaries that the build would ever produce.  Not
# every binary described is necessary actually produced by any given Ninja
# run.  Either the $debug or the $dist file for any individual binary can
# be passed to Ninja as a specific target argument to ensure it's built and
# up to date before making use of that binary.  Like all build_api_module()
# targets, the top-level "binaries" target serves as a Ninja target to
# request that every binary described be built.
#
# Type: list(scope)
#
#   cpu
#     Required: CPU architecture the binary is for, e.g. "arm64" or "x64".
#     Type: string
#
#   os
#     Required: OS the binary is for, e.g. "fuchsia", "linux", or "mac".
#     Type: string
#
#   environment
#     Required: The ${toolchain.environment} name of what specific
#     execution this was built for, e.g. "user", "host", "guest".  The
#     tuple of ($cpu, $os, $environment) should indicate what hardware and
#     software environment this binary is compatible with.
#     Type: string
#
#   label
#     Required: The GN label of the binary target.
#     Type: label_with_toolchain
#
#   type
#     Required: The type of binary.
#     Type: "executable" or "shared_library" or "loadable_module"
#
#   debug
#     Required: Path to where the unstripped or separate debug file is
#     found, relative to $root_build_dir.  If $dist is omitted, this
#     is also the file that is used at runtime.
#     Type: path relative to $root_build_dir
#
#   dist
#     Optional: Path to where the stripped binary for deployment/execution is
#     found, relative to $root_build_dir.  This binary may be required for
#     some debugging tasks if $debug is a separate debug file rather than
#     an unstripped file.  It should exactly match the binary that will be
#     seen on devices or run directly on hosts.
#     Type: path relative to $root_build_dir
#
#   elf_build_id
#     Optional: Path to a file containing the lowercase ASCII hexadecimal
#     representation of the ELF build ID in this binary.  This is omitted
#     for OS environments that don't use ELF.  For an ELF binary that
#     doesn't have a build ID note, this key will be present but point to
#     an empty file.
#     Type: path relative to $root_build_dir
#
#   breakpad
#     Optional: Path to the breakpad symbol file for the debug binary.  This
#     will only be present if $output_breakpad_syms was set.

# Consumers of the build should look here for the images to be built.
# The $cpu, $name, and $type fields identify the purpose of each image.
# Consumers are expected to ignore extra images they have no use for or
# whose fields they don't understand.
#
# The $path field indicates where the file is found in the build
# directory.  The presence of an image in the list means that the build
# *can* produce it, not that the build *will* produce it.  Hence,
# consumers should use $path as an explicit argument to Ninja to ensure
# that each needed image gets built.
#
# Type: list(scope)
#
#   cpu
#     Required: CPU architecture the image is for, e.g. "arm64" or "x64".

#     Note that the name need not be unique within the images list.

#     Type: label_with_toolchain
#
#   path
#     Required: Path to where the file is found, relative to $root_build_dir.

#
#   tags
#     Optional: Tags associated with the image.  Certain tags may indicate
#     to the build API consumer what should be done with the image.
#     Type: list(string)
#
#   type
#     Required: Type of file, e.g. "zbi".  This often corresponds to the
#     extension used on the image file name, but not always.  For many
#     miscellaneous formats, this is just "bin" and the consumer is
#     expected to understand what the particular format is for particular
#     $name, $cpu combinations.  Other types include:
#      * "zbi": the ZBI (<zircon/boot/image.h>) format
#      * "efi": an EFI executable that an EFI boot loader can load
